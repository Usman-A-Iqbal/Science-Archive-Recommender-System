# Science-Archive-Recommender-System
Designed and implemented a database and recommendation system called Science Archives, in Oracle SQL, to provide users with scientific literature recommendations based on their interests. 

• Developed a detailed relational schema based on client specifications obtained from a comprehensive interview. This involved designing an ER diagram (conceptual design) and translating it to a Relational model (logical design).

• Carried out normalisation to ensure the database complies with BCNF

• Implemented the database schema using SQL DDL commands

• Developed SQL queries to support various stages of the Science Archives functionality based on client specifications. This included implementing views and indexes.
